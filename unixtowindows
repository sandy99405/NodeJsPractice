Please choose the default operating mode for reportbug.

1 novice    Offer simple prompts, bypassing technical questions.

2 standard  Offer more extensive prompts, including asking about things that a moderately sophisticated user would be
            expected to know about Debian.

3 advanced  Like standard, but assumes you know a bit more about Debian, including "incoming".

4 expert    Bypass most handholding measures and preliminary triage routines. This mode should not be used by people
            unfamiliar with Debian's policies and operating procedures.

Will reportbug often have direct Internet access? (You should answer yes to this question unless you know what you are
doing and plan to check whether duplicate reports have been filed via some other channel.) [Y|n|q|?]?
