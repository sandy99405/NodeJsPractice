Please choose the default operating mode for reportbug.

1 novice    Offer simple prompts, bypassing technical questions.

2 standard  Offer more extensive prompts, including asking about things that a moderately sophisticated user would be
            expected to know about Debian.

3 advanced  Like standard, but assumes you know a bit more about Debian, including "incoming".

            unfamiliar with Debian's policies and operating procedures.
