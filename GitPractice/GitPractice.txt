1) git add -A

2) git config --global alias.aliasName '!git add -A && git commit -m' // If we dont put '!git' , git will think that you want to add git infront of your command

3) git alisaName "New Commit"   // Two commands combined

3) git commit -a -m 'New commit'     /// but this doesn't add the all the files but the only files that are in the working/current directory

4) git config --global alias.ac 'commit -a -m'

5) git log         // prints all our recent commits

6) git revert hashcode  // here hashcode is the unique hash of a commit // This command undoes the commit that we mention by creating a new commit but keeping the old commit.
    
     for example : git revert a12c136cbf4b4907c91adacedc761c5a702a91f4

7) git revert HEAD // it is going to undo the most recent commit by creating a brand new commit.
